Given a set of conformers in xyz format (same atom numbering), writes the conformation of the molecule by analyzing the dihedral angles specified in the tcl script.

Run batch.sh to execute.

Some sample conformers of diglyme are included.

Conformations are marked as:

t -> trans

g, g0 -> gauche (ca. 60° cw, ccw)

x, x0 -> ca. 90° cw, ccw

t00 -> eclipsed
