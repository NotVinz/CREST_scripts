Given a set of conformers (same atom numbering), writes the conformation of the molecule by analyzing the dihedral angles specified in the tcl script.
Some sample conformers of diglyme are included.

Conformations are marked as:
t -> trans
g, g0 -> gauche (ca. 60° cw, ccw)
x, x0 -> ca. 90° cw, ccw
t0 -> eclipsed
